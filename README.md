## Explanation

NanoHash Invoice is a simple, lightweight, and fast invoicing system that allows you to enter products or services with their quantity and price, automatically calculate subtotals, taxes, and totals, and generate a clear and professional invoice. The system offers an intuitive and seamless experience, with real-time validations, currency conversion, and PDF generation. The entire workflow is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and fully functional, demonstrating a clean implementation focused on a real-world problem.

## Description of the Custom Feature

As a custom feature, the project incorporates a blockchain-inspired verification system that generates a unique SHA-256 cryptographic hash for each invoice, guaranteeing its integrity and authenticity. This hash is displayed to the user and integrated into a QR code for easy verification, preventing modifications or duplication. In addition, the system includes multi-currency conversion, automatic PDF generation, and an invoice history, resulting in a complete, secure, modern, and intuitive solution without sacrificing simplicity or performance.
